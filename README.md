# Data-collection-challenge

This challenge was fun to solve. The many new concepts that were practiced are webscaping to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Above skills were used to automate identification of HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

The core skills used for this project are: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating the insights.

The part-1 & part-2 Jupyter Notebooks contain the code and the relevant data gleaned from the Mars Weather Data Table. The table scraped from the Mars Weather Temperature Data Site { https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html } has been stored in a file called "mars_data.csv" in a folder call "data". Both the folder and the csv files get created by the Python code.
